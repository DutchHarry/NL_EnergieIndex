Unfortunately this data doens't preserve history.

Otherwise you'd see that the housing associations (woningbouwcorporaties) are busy artificially enhancing their 'energy efficiency'.
Several flats suddenly moving from label D to B without any serious changes to the buildings.
In short they are massaging the numbers instead of managing the operations when it comes to their durability (NL:duurzaamheid) targets

Managing only numbers seems a typical (but not exclusivily) Dutch disease
